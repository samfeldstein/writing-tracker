# 🖋️ The Simplest Writing Tracker

A simple terminal-based application to track my writing. It comprises a `log.csv` and three Python scripts.

You start the app by running `python scripts/main.py`. It prompts you to enter your project name, start time, start words, end time, and end words.

When you've entered everything, it adds a new line to `log.csv` and immediately prints your stats.
