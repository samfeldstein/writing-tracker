# 🖋️ The Simplest Writing Tracker

A simple terminal-based application to track my writing.

Start the app by running `python scripts/main.py`. It prompts you to enter your project name, start time, start words, end time, and end words.

When you've entered everything, it adds a new line to `log.csv` and immediately prints your stats.
